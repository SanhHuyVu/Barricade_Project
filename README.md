Since the "GamePlay" scene (GamePlay.unity file) is heavy i uploaded it into google drive:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HtAMkXl3A3QiTxBmtaoKSzZXfbrAOMfO?usp=drive_link

- after cloning the project and downloading the GamePlay.unity file simply move the GamePlay.unity file to *directory*/Barricade_Project/Assets/Scenes
